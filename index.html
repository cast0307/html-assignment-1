            <div> <p> My name is Daniel Castro Alvarado, I am 21 years old, and I come from one of the countries with more nature
            and biodiversity in the world, often known as the <em> Central American Switzerland. </em> Definetely one of
            the <strong> <u> top #10 happiest</u> </strong> places to live in the world; which name is Costa Rica. I am
            currently living in 27 <sup> th </sup> Woodfield <abbr> Dr. </abbr> on my own. However, this is my 1 <sup>
                st </sup> time ever living abroad, so it has been a whole new experience for me and I am looking forward
            to experiencing things in all ways possible.  </p> </div>

        <p>
            I consider myself a very easygoing person who like to see the funny side of things and challenge myself
            everyday. I am a sports lover, being soccer my biggest passion and hobby, spending almost all day talking
            about it. <a href="#hobbies"> <strong> (More hobbies...) </strong> </a>
        </p>

        <p> Besides that, I also love spending time with my family and friends and hanging around with them. One of my
            biggest dreams is to be able to work as a freelancer in what I like, travel all over the world, and
            eventually, watch an interesting final game of a World Cup.
